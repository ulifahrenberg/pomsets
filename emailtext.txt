as an offshoot of the (i)Po(m)set Project Online Seminar, we are planning to organise a workshop in Rennes on

    Pomsets and Related Structures

on Wednesday 24 April, and I thought you might be interested.  See

    https://ulifahrenberg.github.io/pomsets/
    
This email is a pre-announcement to gauge interest.  Could you please tell me

- whether you'd like to come?

- whether you'd like to give a talk, and if so, whether in person or online?

- whether you'd like to send other people or to propose other people to give talks?

- whether you'd like to join the program committee for this event?  (Workload will be very light; we don't plan actual publications and just need people to judge credibility of 3-page abstracts.)


Cheers,
Uli
