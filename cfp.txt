               Pomsets and Related Structures

We are organizing a workshop on pomsets and related structures at
EPITA Rennes in centre town. The workshop is collocated with the ATLAS
workshop on automata, transducers, logic, algebras & semigroups and
will be followed by the annual meeting of the French working group on
data, automata, algebra, and logic (GT DAAL).

The themes of the workshop are partial-order semantics, concurrency
theory, automata theory, algebra, and geometry. It aims to understand
the basics of concurrency theory and develop its foundations. We
welcome contributions in any of the above areas and in neighboring
subjects such as for example distributed systems, coalgebra, Petri
nets, or trace theory.

We are calling for presentations of original, unfinished, already
published, or otherwise interesting work which can highlight how the
research topics of the workshop may be developed. The workshop will
have no formal proceedings, but we might organize a journal special
issue afterwards.

Please send your proposal, in the form of a pdf file of 1-3 pages, to
uli.fahrenberg@epita.fr by 22 March 2024.

Should you wish to participate but need financial support for doing
so, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can arrange
things.
